## Desires

1. Warm metal finish, not shiny
2. Fits our 1917 house (not modern)
3. Includes tub fill, shower head, and hand shower
4. Shower and hand shower can run either one or both (three modes)
5. Finish can coordinate with other manufacturers (vanity, door hardware, medicine cabinet)

## Implications for the plumbing/control setup

To meet the "either/or/both" requirement, we should plan on:

- A valve and trim that supports multiple outlets
- A diverter configuration that allows combined flow (not just A/B switching)

## Shortlist structure

When we add candidates below, include:

- Manufacturer + collection
- Finish name
- Control/d diverter type (and whether it supports "both")
- Notes on cross-brand finish matching
