# Tub Selection (North Alcove)

[back](../README.md)

This remodel must use a single combined tub/shower in the north-wall alcove.

## Requirements

1. Combined tub and shower (no room for separate areas)
2. Tub must fit the north-wall alcove footprint
   - Target max tub size: up to 72" x 36"
   - Actual wall-to-wall space: about 82"

## Desires

- Built-in look (avoid a builder-grade acrylic front apron look)
- Extra-wide tub that can feel closer to a stand-in shower width

## Known issues and constraints

- Drop-in and undermount tubs do not pair well with a combined shower without a wet-room style floor drain, and the step-over is uncomfortable for showering.
- Freestanding tubs do not work well in an alcove and would require a full curtain ring, which is not desirable.
- Alcove tubs with a non-apron front (or removable apron / flange-front options) are limited.

## Working direction

We should bias toward an alcove tub up to 72" x 36" that:

- Maximizes interior standing room (prioritize width where possible)
- Supports a tileable or skirted front solution
- Has a solid, traditional profile that fits the house
- Is compatible with a full shower surround and proper water management
