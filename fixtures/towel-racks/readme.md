## Desires

1. **Works in a tight pass-by zone** — folds flat or minimal projection when not in use
2. **Dries towels** — keeps towels separated so they don't stay damp
3. **Looks intentional** — classic/architectural, not dorm-room hardware
4. **Capacity:** 3 towels ideal, 2 minimum
5. **Finish harmony** with LSG (satin brass/brushed gold acceptable)
6. **Style:** 1917 Mediterranean Revival-ish — avoid cheap modern look

## Constraints

- **Nook location:** narrow vertical nook behind the "head" of the tub (opposite the drain side)
- **Nook height:** ~8'+
- **Clearance to door casing:** ~6" from finished wall to door framing/casing line
- **Splash zone:** towels are out of splash range
- **Finish:** primary plumbing is California Faucets LSG (Lifetime Satin Gold); coordinate with satin brass or brushed gold

## Shortlist

### Heated vertical bars

Mount individual heated bars vertically in the nook — each bar = one towel position. Primary preference; warm towels are a priority.

- **Capacity:** 2 bars minimum; 3 bars for full 3-towel target
- **Finish:** look for satin brass / brushed gold options (e.g., Amba, Myson, Zehnder)
- **Build note:** requires new electrical run + controller + concealed boxes — currently estimated at **~$3k+** due to glued/screwed subfloor making routing harder
- **Projection:** adds ~4–6" into the 6" clearance lane — confirm dimensions before committing

**Pros:** spa vibe; warm towels; sleek and visually simple.

**Cons:** significant electrical cost and build complexity; tight projection in a 6" lane.

### Swivel hooks on two walls

Use both walls at the tub-head corner (the 6" lane wall and the perpendicular return wall). Install 2 swivel/pivot hooks per wall, staggered so towels don't overlap.

- **Suggested layout (hook center heights):**
  - 6" lane wall: 70" and 56–58"
  - Return wall: 76" and 62–64"
- **Spacing:** 12" workable; 14–16" better for full-size bath towels
- **Fold direction:** aim flat toward corner
- **Build note:** add blocking behind each location now

**Pros:** best functional drying for 3 towels (separation + airflow); no electrical; easy to replace or upgrade later; classic look is easy to achieve.

**Cons:** finish match will be "coordinate," not exact LSG; cheap swivel hooks feel flimsy — choose solid brass with concealed mounting.

### Vertical swivel-peg rail

A slim vertical rail with multiple independent swivel pegs/hooks that rotate out and fold back flat.

**Pros:** one clean element; looks designed; holds 3+ towels; often folds relatively flat.

**Cons:** harder to find a truly classic/1917 look — many read more contemporary; finish options vary; some multi-hook rails feel commercial.

**Good use case:** simplest install (one object, one set of screw locations) and a slightly more modern line is acceptable.

### Hybrid: swivel hooks + warming elsewhere

Use the swivel hook or rail approach in the nook and add towel-warming comfort via a plug-in warmer on a different wall or a countertop warming bucket.

A variation worth considering: replace the standard radiator with a **towel-rack radiator** (a radiator designed with horizontal bars for draping towels). This keeps the heating function while adding passive towel warming — no extra electrical run needed.

- **Tradeoff:** the flat top of a standard radiator was planned as shelf space; a towel-rack radiator gives that up.

**Pros:** solves drying/storage with minimal build complexity; warm towels without tearing into finished work; lower cost; easier to change later.

**Cons:** warmth isn't coming from the nook; a warming bucket is more appliance than architecture; radiator swap loses planned shelf space on top.

## Finish guidance

- Primary finish: **California Faucets LSG** (Lifetime Satin Gold)
- Closest coordinating finishes:
  - **Satin Brass** — often the best match across brands
  - **Brushed Gold** — varies; can skew yellower or warmer
  - **Aged / Antique Brass** — more patina; can look great in a 1917 house but less "matchy"
- For towel hooks/bars, "close enough" is acceptable — towels cover the hardware and these act as secondary accents.

## Final decision

**Approach:** TBD

**Hardware:** TBD

**Finish:** TBD

**Install heights:** TBD

**Notes:** TBD

## Notes / installer checklist

- [ ] Choose approach (heated bars / swivel hooks / rail / hybrid)
- [ ] If heated bars: confirm electrical routing cost and confirm projection fits 6" lane
- [ ] If swivel hooks: add blocking at all hook locations before closing walls
- [ ] Confirm hook/bar projection folded vs. open — target as flat as possible in the 6" lane
- [ ] Confirm finish (satin brass / brushed gold / aged brass) — get in-hand sample if needed
- [ ] Confirm install heights (adjust to tile layout/grout lines if desired)
