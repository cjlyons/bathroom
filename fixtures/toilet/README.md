## Desires

1. **Main bath reliability:** strong, consistent flush; minimal clogging.
2. **Elongated bowl** (“oval”) for comfort.
3. **Comfort height** / chair height.
4. **Quality seat that doesn’t wobble** (no side-to-side movement; feels solid).
5. **Classic styling** that fits a 1917 Mediterranean Revival home (not ultra-modern).
6. **White**.

## Implications for plumbing / install

- **Rough-in:** confirm existing is **12"** (most common). If it’s 10" or 14", model choice narrows.
- **Drainline carry:** older homes can benefit from a little more water per flush; if plumbing is original/older, 1.6 gpf can be a “less drama” choice.
- **Wax ring & flange:** if the flange is low or uneven, use an appropriate wax/waxless solution and shim correctly to avoid rocking (rocking = future leaks).
- **Supply line / shutoff:** replace old shutoff if crusty; use a new braided supply line.

## Shortlist structure

For each candidate below include:

- Manufacturer + model line
- Height + bowl shape
- Flush volume (1.28 vs 1.6)
- Flush performance (MaP score if known)
- Notes on maintenance/parts availability
- Seat plan (bundle vs separate)

## Shortlist

### Kohler Memoirs Stately (2-piece)

- **Models:** K-3817-0 (1.28 gpf) and K-3819-0 (1.6 gpf)
- **Why it’s on the list:** classic/traditional profile; strong flush reputation; matches the style of the bath.
- **Notes:**
  - K-3817 and K-3819 share the same bowl; difference is tank/flush volume.
  - Choose **K-3819-0** if we want maximum drainline carry / older plumbing insurance.
- **Seat plan:** buy seat separately (see Seat decision).

### TOTO Drake / Drake II (2-piece)

- **Why it’s on the list:** “workhorse” reliability, easy parts, strong real-world performance.
- **Notes:**
  - Styling is more neutral/utility than Memoirs, but still not “modern.”
  - Often available with a decent SoftClose seat bundle (still evaluate wobble).
- **Seat plan:** if bundled seat feels flimsy, upgrade to a better TOTO seat.

### TOTO UltraMax II (1-piece)

- **Why it’s on the list:** one-piece is easier to wipe down; feels premium; very common.
- **Notes:**
  - A bit more “hotel modern” than Memoirs, depending on the rest of the bath.
  - Typically costs more than a Drake.

### Kohler Highline (2-piece)

- **Why it’s on the list:** widely available, serviceable, solid reputation; “boring in a good way.”
- **Notes:**
  - Look is simpler than Memoirs; can work if we want the toilet to disappear visually.

### American Standard Champion 4 (2-piece)

- **Why it’s on the list:** designed for clog resistance.
- **Notes:**
  - We have negative seat experience with an older American Standard; if we pick this, we still do a premium seat.

## Seat decision

We care about:

- No wobble / no side-to-side movement
- Solid feel (not thin/cheap)
- Slow-close
- Easy to remove for cleaning

**Kohler pick (ReadyLatch):**

- **K-4636-RL-0** (Cachet ReadyLatch Quiet-Close, elongated, white)
  - Grip-Tight style bumpers + ReadyLatch removal makes cleaning and re-centering easy.
  - Install tip: tighten firmly, then re-tighten after ~1 week (seat hardware settles).

(If we go TOTO, choose an equivalent high-quality SoftClose seat with solid hinge hardware and a secure mounting system.)

## Flush handle finish

Goal: match other bath hardware where possible.

- Toilets generally ship with a chrome lever.
- For Kohler Memoirs, swap the trip lever to a brass/gold family finish (brushed/satin).
- Confirm **left-hand** lever orientation for Memoirs Stately tank.

## Final decision

**Toilet:**

- [Kohler **K-3819-0** (Memoirs Stately, elongated, comfort height, 1.6 gpf)](https://www.kohler.com/en/products/toilets/shop-toilets/memoirs-stately-comfort-height-two-piece-elongated-1-6-gpf-chair-height-toilet-3819?skuId=3819-0)

**Seat:**

- [Kohler **K-4636-RL-0** (Cachet ReadyLatch Quiet-Close, elongated, white)](https://www.kohler.com/en/products/toilet-seats-bidet-seats/shop-toilet-seats-bidet-seats/cachet-readylatch-quiet-close-elongated-toilet-seat-4636-rl?skuId=4636-RL-0)

**Handle finish:**

- [Replace stock lever with a Kohler Memoirs-compatible left-hand trip lever in the closest brass/gold finish to the bath hardware.](https://www.kohler.com/en/products/toilet-accessories/shop-toilet-accessories/memoirs-trip-lever-9167-l?skuId=9167-L-2MB)

## Notes / installer checklist

- Verify 12" rough-in and buy the correct rough-in version.
- Confirm flange condition and toilet sits flat (shim as needed).
- Use a new supply line and consider replacing the shutoff if old.
- After installing seat, re-tighten once after a week.
